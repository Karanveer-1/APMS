isLeaf will determine the leaf WP

PROBLEM:


I need to fix the update project for supervisors and worckpages for PM
make project management ajax
fix adding new WP
modify WP.leaf whenever a WP is created or modified or deleted





Add a new PROJECT
  => a new workpackage is added and its not a leaf
  => every new workpckage added can be defined as leaf or not leaf
  Edit/Add/Delete function will be disabled if wp is a leaf
  can't edit leaf or not leaf
  can edit leaf or non-leaf's information like description, name ... but not start end date blah blah



 add a new column a WorkPackage
 always check the budget for the non-leaf so it aligns with their leaves addition
  can delete if there no estimated or children
